## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains a deep dive into Pythonic abstraction techniques. Unlike standard tutorials, this project emphasizes:
* **Contract-Driven Development:** Using `abc.ABC` to enforce blueprints.
* **Duck Typing:** Exploring Python's dynamic nature for flexible interfaces.
* **Real-World Application:** An e-commerce case study showing how abstraction manages complex cloud and payment services.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom midnight-blue theme), Bootstrap 5.
- **Interactivity:** Vanilla JavaScript (Search filters, Quiz engine).
- **Code Highlighting:** Prism.js for high-fidelity Python syntax.
- **SEO & Performance:** Optimized metadata, `sitemap.xml`, and `robots.txt` for Google AdSense readiness.
